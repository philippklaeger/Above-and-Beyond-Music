### Why hearables are not yet the successors of headphones

## Introduction
How attractive is the adaption of hearing enhancement functions in headphones in the eyes of consumers?

To answer this question, we conducted a survey-based analysis to assess the attractiveness of the hearable market for traditional headphone companies. The survey was operationalized with the Qualtrics Survey Tool, while the analysis was done with a clustering analysis in SPSS.


## Key Takeaways
* *Status Quo*: headphones and hearing aids are two mostly separate markets right now - but due to technological advancements, they are likely to fuse into one market in the foreseeable future. Traditional hearing aid manufacturers have already moved to enter the other market.
* *Market potential*: the new use case of hearing enhancement is not yet associated with concrete consumer knowledge (e.g. WTP). Hence, these prognostications can only serve as first orientation. Age does not seem to be a relevant factor, as we observe similar interests in the segments across vast differences in age.
* *Demand for hearables*: the inclusion of hearing enhancement functions represents an attractive but challenging use case for headphone companies in the foreseeable future. 58% of the respondents see substantial benefits in headphones with hearing enhancement functions.
* *Challenges*: persuasion and transfer of associations is needed to successfully enter the market. The Headphone Company must gain reputation for hearing enhancement features (e.g. brand alliance with medical specialists, quality certificates etc.) first, before the market becomes accessible.

Hearables could become the successors of regular headphones in the future, once the headphone companies acquired the necessary reputation for the new features in the minds of the consumers.
